# Gender-Representation-in-Superhero-Universe

## Project Overview
This project explores the representation of gender in the superhero universe, focusing on the differences between male and female superheroes based on various factors. The analysis uses the Superhero Characters and Powers dataset, which includes details about numerous superheroes from diverse storylines and fictional universes, covering their physical, mental, and supernatural abilities.

## Problem Statement
Despite the long history of male-dominated superhero universes, the recent surge in popularity of female superheroes has challenged traditional gender roles and expectations. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of gender representation in the superhero universe, contributing to the ongoing conversation about the role of women in popular culture.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/baraazaid/superherodb). It includes information about:
- Character origins (creators, universe, collections)
- Alignment (good, bad, neutral)
- Physical abilities (power, strength, speed, durability)
- Superpowers
- Other attributes (gender, membership in groups, species, relatives, place of birth, occupation)

## Analysis Sections

### 1. Examining Gender Balance
- **Gender Distribution:** Analyzes the overall gender ratio among superheroes.
- **Moral Alignments:** Compares the moral alignments (good, bad, neutral) of male and female superheroes.
- **Creator Preferences:** Investigates the gender preference of top creators in the superhero universe.
- **Power Levels:** Compares the power levels of male and female superheroes.

### 2. Comparing Superhero Capabilities
- **Physical Abilities:** Compares physical abilities (combat, power, durability, strength, speed) of male and female superheroes.
- **Mental Abilities:** Compares mental abilities (IQ, intelligence) of male and female superheroes.
- **Superpowers:** Analyzes the distribution of superpowers between male and female superheroes.

### 3. Investigating Female Superheroes
- **Weapon Usage:** Examines the proportion of female superheroes who use weapons.
- **Top Female Superheroes:** Identifies the top 50 female superheroes based on physical abilities.

## Key Findings
- There is a significant gender imbalance in the creation of superheroes, with males being more represented.
- Female superheroes are more likely to be portrayed as good rather than bad or neutral.
- There is no significant difference in the power levels and physical abilities of male and female superheroes.
- Mental abilities (IQ and intelligence) are slightly higher for male superheroes.
- The top superpowers are similar for both genders, with some variations in specific abilities.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the existing disparities in gender representation among superheroes while also showing areas of equality in terms of abilities. This analysis can help promote more balanced and positive representation of female superheroes in popular culture.
